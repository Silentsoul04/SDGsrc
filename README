pkgsrc is a framework for building software on UNIX-like systems.

To use, bootstrap using:
% cd pkgsrc/bootstrap/
% ./bootstrap

build packages, use:
% cd pkgsrc/category/package-name
% $PREFIX/bin/bmake install

Where $PREFIX is where you've chosen to install packages (typically /usr/pkg)

Bugs and patches can be filed in the follow link (use category 'pkg'):
https://www.netbsd.org/cgi-bin/sendpr.cgi?gndb=netbsd

To fetch the main CVS repository:
% cvs -d anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot checkout -P pkgsrc

It's also possible to contribute through pkgsrc wip (work in progress), for
more information, see http://pkgsrc.org/wip/users/

Please ignore doc/pkgsrc.txt for information, it's not maintained.

This is just neat source tree for me, not for you.
Feel free to fork this repository and create your neat source tree.
But you MUST NOT apply diffs in this repository to your tree without
understanding the full meaning of it, especially for TNF pkgsrc tree.
It require PROPOSED AND DISCUSSED FIRST before commit and start to
bikeshed discussion for several years.
I would like to say "It's wrong" without particular reason to the
propose, it's the TNF way.

Above notes are neither LICENSE not COPYRIGHT restriction, it's just
a manner, but it is clear that quite a bit of patches originally from
pkgsrc have unclear LICENSE and/or COPYRIGHT, so you have to be very
careful when you have a mind to send diffs to upstream developers.

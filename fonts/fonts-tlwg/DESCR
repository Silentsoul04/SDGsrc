Fonts-TLWG is a collection of Thai scalable fonts available under free
licenses.  Its goal is to provide fonts that conform to existing standards
and recommendations, so that it can be a reference implementation.

So, the fonts have been modified from their original versions as needed,
according to following references:
  - Recommendation for Thai font design, from the National Font Project
  - Adobe Glyph naming convention
  - Microsoft Typography
  - Common practice for Thai Windows fonts

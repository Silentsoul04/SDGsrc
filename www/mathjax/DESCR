MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and
AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.  It was designed with
the goal of consolidating the recent advances in web technologies into a
single, definitive, math-on-the-web platform supporting the major browsers
and operating systems.  It requires no setup on the part of the user (no
plugins to download or software to install), so the page author can write
web documents that include mathematics and be confident that users will be
able to view it naturally and easily.  Simply include MathJax and some
mathematics in a web page, and MathJax does the rest.

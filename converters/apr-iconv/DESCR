APR-iconv provides a portable iconv() implementation built on top of APR.
It is generally of interest only where no system provided iconv() is available
(either in libiconv, or libc as applicable). An example is the Windows platform,
where APR-iconv is required to enable the APR-util library's apr_xlate feature.

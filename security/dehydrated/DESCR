This is a client for signing certificates with an ACME-server
(currently only provided by Let's Encrypt) implemented as a
relatively simple bash-script.
Dehydrated supports both ACME v1 and the new ACME v2 including
support for wildcard certificates!

It uses the `openssl` utility for everything related to
actually handling keys and certificates,
so you need to have that installed.

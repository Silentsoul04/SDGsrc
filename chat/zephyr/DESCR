Zephyr allows users to send messages to other users or to groups of
users.  Users can view incoming Zephyr messages as windowgrams
(transient X windows) or as text on a terminal. Zephyr can optionally
make use of the Kerberos version 4 security library or the Hesiod
service name resolution library.

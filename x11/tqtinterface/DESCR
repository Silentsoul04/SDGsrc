This package includes libraries that abstract the underlying Qt system from
the actual Trinity code, allowing easy, complete upgrades to new versions of Qt.

It also contains various functions that have been removed from newer versions
of Qt, but are completely portable and isolated from other APIs such as Xorg.
This allows the Trinity project to efficiently perform certain operations that
are infeasible or unneccessarily difficult when using pure Qt4 or above.

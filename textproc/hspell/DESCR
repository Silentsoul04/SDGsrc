Hspell was designed to be 100% and strictly compliant with the official
niqqud-less spelling rules ("Ha-ktiv Khasar Ha-niqqud", colloquially known as
"Ktiv Male", or "plene spelling" in English), published by the Academy of
the Hebrew Language. This is both an advantage and a disadvantage, depending
on your viewpoint. It's an advantage because it encourages a *correct* and
consistent spelling style throughout your writing. It is a disadvantage,
because a few of the Academia's official spelling decisions are relatively
unknown to the general public.

A fork from google pinyin on android.

This is not a long term project, it only began as some kind of prove concept
project.

This project is only forked form out dated code of Google Pinyin on Android
(Not the desktop version), and Google no longer provides up to date code for it
since 2009.

If you are interested in full featured pinyin input method, please try libpinyin
or sunpinyin, they are both supported by fcitx and ibus.  They use more advanced
algorithm (2-gram vs thie project's unigream) and support more feature, like
Shuangpin, Zhuyin, Fuzzy Pinyin and so on.
